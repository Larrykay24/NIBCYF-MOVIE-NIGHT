As you know if you don't - just google it all of the data that has been encrypted by our software cannot be recovered by any means without contacting our team directly
If you try to use any additional recovery software - the files might be damaged so if you are willing to try - try it on the data of the lowest value

To make sure that we REALLY CAN get your data back - we offer you to decrypt 2 random files completely free of charge

You can contact our team directly for further instructions through our contact: https://t.me/Diamotrix
